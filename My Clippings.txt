The shaman’s instructions were quite specific: bring only a sleeping bag, a flashlight, water, and a knife for the vision quest. The first three items were critical for my survival. The last one was mostly for my peace of mind,

I came to recognize that there’s a fundamental difference between hunger and craving. Hunger is a biological message, and it is something that you can control. Craving is a psychological need, and it is something that tries to control you.

the most insidious problems—the ones so ubiquitous that you hardly notice them at all. Even if you look and feel fit, you probably live with a background hum of fear. There is an ancient part of you that is always worried about what will happen if your food goes away, and, by extension, you fear all of the other things that might go missing. It is a subtle, pervasive, biological survival instinct, but you don’t have to let it control you.

Ketones are another important part of the biology of fasting. If your body isn’t getting enough glucose from what you’re eating and drinking, your liver and muscles use all the carbohydrates stored in your body, then prepare an alternate source of energy by converting fat into smaller molecules—ketones. The ketones circulate through the bloodstream and go to your muscle cells and other body tissues. This state is called ketosis; your body is literally burning fat as its primary fuel source.

To maintain healthy gut bacteria levels with or without a fast, you can take various types of prebiotic fiber. These are marvelously useful substances that are compatible with most kinds of fasts. Soluble fiber attracts water in your stomach and intestines and turns into a gel, which slows the digestive process. Common sources of dietary fiber include oats, bran, nuts, and seeds, none of which are fasting compatible. Instead, you can opt for a blend of acacia gum, guar gum, and larch arabinogalactan. These scary-sounding things are just plant-based tree saps that you can buy as flavorless powders that blend well into coffee or any other liquid.

Once I got used to not watching TV, I realized how much I hadn’t really wanted to watch it in the first place. Today, more than twenty years later, I’ve kept my TV-free habit. I’ve probably saved a few thousand dollars and definitely saved many thousands of hours of my time, time that I was able to use more productively. Instead of watching TV three or four hours a day, I’ve been reading books, writing, recording almost a thousand podcast episodes, starting companies, and playing with my kids. It all started with a planned two-year TV fast.

That’s why Cameron Sepah recommends dopamine fasting: to help break you free from those cravings. A dopamine fast helps liberate your brain from its addiction to the emotional jolts of movies and TV shows. When your body expends less energy on metabolizing junk food, it devotes more resources to autophagy and cellular repair. When your mind expends less energy processing junk culture, it devotes more resources to the creativity and original thinking.

In one such seminar a wise professor asked the class what all of the world’s most extreme and violent religious fanatics had in common.

Their actions are rational if you believe what they do.”

On an intuitive level, it’s easy to know that certain foods make us feel good and others make us feel bad. Two millennia ago, the ancient Greeks interpreted these feelings in a spiritual way: they believed that eating and drinking allowed demonic spirits into the body and embraced fasting as a way to achieve purification by keeping the demons at bay. As naive as that might sound in the modern age, they were onto something. When we eat and drink, harmful agents do enter the body. Today we call them toxins. If they trigger inflammation, they are referred to as inflammogens.

When you fast, your body takes energy that would normally be used to digest food and redirects it to healing and repair. Your cells need nourishment and oxygen to thrive, but lifestyle choices such as being sedentary or dietary choices such as overeating or eating toxin-laden foods that result in digestive issues promote cellular degeneration and what biologists delicately call apoptosis. Let’s just call it what it is: cell death.

Social bonding is yet another way to reduce inflammation, by the way. In 2020, a group of researchers at the University of Surrey and at Brunel University London found that social isolation is associated with increased inflammation in the body. Isolated people showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a protein produced in the liver, which normally floods tissues after an injury. It also elevates levels of fibrinogen, which promotes blood clotting. The research team also found that the link between social isolation and inflammation was stronger among men than women.6
